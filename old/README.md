# HueBoo

HueBoo is an open source tool built to help engineers and designers create color sets that are lit AF. The project is open source, the app is in the iOS AppStore and I encourage anybody interested in making it better to submit pull requests or feedback through the app. The app is heavily focused on providing useful color information for everybody that wants to engage with it.

Feel free to clone and submit your own version.

# Features

HueBoo allows you to generate random colors, and the hexidecimal & RGB values associated with them. This functionality is useful for both engineers and designers. 

# Releases
